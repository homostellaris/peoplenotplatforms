**Our mission is to bring people closer by making the platforms they use an unimportant detail.**

With People Not Platforms you can create a profile that captures your online presence and start sharing it within minutes.
Your profile is kind of like an internet contact card that can be shared and embedded anywhere on the web.

Rather than investing a lot of effort in creating your own personal website you may find it easier to just refer people to your People Not Platforms profile.
If you do prefer your own domain its trivial to embed your People Not Platforms in your existing website.

This is only the beginning, we've got tonnes of ideas about how to make it effortless for people to follow those they're interested in.

If you think you'd benefit from our mission then we'd love you to help us shape the product and build it with us! The easiest way you can do this is by using the app and creating profiles.
