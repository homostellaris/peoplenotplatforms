      <p>
        Our mission is to bring people closer by making the platforms they use
        an unimportant detail.

        How many times have you seen something like this on a person&apos;s
        website?

        Why can&apos;t you just follow the person you are interested in on the
        platforms you use with a single click?
      </p>
      <h2>This is just the beginning</h2>
      <p>
        What you&apos;re using right now is just an early iteration of our
        product, you can think of it a bit like a digital business card that
        encapsulates your online presence and gives you a single link to share
        with others.
      </p>
      <p>Here&apos;s an example!</p>
      {/* TODO: Fix this for smaller sizes */}
      <iframe
        src="https://peoplenotplatforms.com/person/5eef2e0fa1f40f00213627d9/view"
        title="Example profile"
      ></iframe>
      <p>
        While we&apos;ve not achieved the one-click dream just yet, this is an
        important stepping stone on that path.
      </p>
      <h2>Let us know what you think</h2>
      <p>
        If you think you&apos;d benefit from our mission then we&apos;d love you
        to help us shape the product and build it with us! The easiest way you
        can do this is by using the app, creating profiles, and providing any
